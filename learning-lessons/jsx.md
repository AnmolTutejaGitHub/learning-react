JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, which React then transforms into JavaScript objects.

Key Points about JSX:

	1.	Syntax: JSX syntax looks like HTML, but it is actually syntactic sugar for React.createElement() calls. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
    ```
    const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
    ```
    This is equivalent to:
    ```
    const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
    ```

JSX is not valid JavaScript by itself, so it needs to be compiled into plain JavaScript before it can be run in a browser. This transformation is typically handled by tools like Babel.

In summary, JSX is a powerful syntax extension for React that makes it easier to write and understand the UI code by combining JavaScript and HTML-like syntax.
